ðŸ’» My Development Toolkit
To build this project, I leaned on a few key tools that made the development process much smoother:

I used Gemini Pro for brainstorming features and getting help with complex code snippets.

Cursor served as my AI-powered code editor, helping me refactor and write code more efficiently.

For UI prototyping and design, I used Lovable and Windsurf to quickly build and test components.
